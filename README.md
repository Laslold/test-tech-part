   - Navigate to the directory where you want to place your project:

   - Run the `git clone` command to clone the repository. Replace
     `repository-URL` with the copied URL:

   ![git clone repository-URL](./assets/Scr2.jpg)

   - Move into the project folder:

     ![cd project-folder-name](./assets/Scr3.jpg)

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   - Inside the project folder, run the command to install the dependencies:

     ![npm install](./assets/Scr4.jpg)

4. **Run the React Application:**

     application:

5. **View the Application:**

     application.
